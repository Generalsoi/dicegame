# dicegame

A simple dice game simulator website. Users can play the game by refreshing the site. Once refreshed, the player with the highest number on his dice wins. 
It is more static than dynamic, i.e users cannot influence the number that would pop up when the dice is rolled(page is refreshed). 

Was trying out my understading of basic javascript implementation.
